# Personal-Portfolio
Personal Portfolio of Alec van Helsdingen__
Replaces, as of October 2021, my Atlassian Bitbucket repository__

## Image Processing
A university assignment in 2018. These Matlab function files implement the K-means algorithm.__
The algorithm is applied to an image, and the number of colours used in the image is reduced.__
This is a method of compressing the file.__

## Ireland Dail
This is a personal project. The files in this folder are used to make predictions for elections in Ireland.__
The election system used there is STV (Single Transferable Vote).__

## Microbit
These files were written by me and partly by University of Auckland staff in 2019. The files play "paper-scissors-rock"__
on a BBC "Microbit" device.__

## Simplex Method
These Matlab files implement the Revised Simplex Method for solving linear programs. Each subfolder is independent of the others.__
Written in 2020.__

## Writing
Exemplars of my writing.
