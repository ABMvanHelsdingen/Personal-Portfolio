# Personal-Portfolio
Personal Portfolio of Alec van Helsdingen

## Data Science
Contains a SQL University assignment. 

## Image Processing
A university assignment in 2018. These Matlab function files implement the K-means algorithm.
The algorithm is applied to an image, and the number of colours used in the image is reduced.
This is a method of compressing the file.

## Ireland Dail
This is a personal project. The files in this folder are used to make predictions for elections in Ireland.
This is coded in Python. 

## Microbit
These files were written by me and partly by University of Auckland staff in 2019. The files play "paper-scissors-rock"
on a BBC "Microbit" device.

## Simplex Method
These Matlab files implement the Revised Simplex Method for solving linear programs. Each subfolder is independent of the others.
Written in 2020.

## Writing
Exemplars of my writing from 2019 and 2020.
